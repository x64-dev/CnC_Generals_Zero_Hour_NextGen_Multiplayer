## Compiling with Visual Studio 2022
1. Make sure **MFC** is installed.
2. Either build the **RTS** or **WorldBuild** project – doing so will build everything you need.

---

## (Optional) Compiling the 3DS Max Plugin
- Requires a copy of the **3DS Max 4.x SDK**, placed in `Code\Libraries\max4sdk`.
- The SDK is available from `maxsdk.zip` on the 3DS Max CD.

*(Note: The Max plugin is not required to run the game.)*

---

## Running the Game
- The game now supports loading **loose files** for easier modding.
- To distribute or ship your mod, package your loose files into a `.big` file.
- If you'd like to unpack existing `.big` files, download a **big extractor** and extract all `.big` files into the game folder *(extract patch files last)*.
- After extraction, you can safely delete the original `.big` files.

Enjoy modding and playing Command & Conquer Generals NextGen Fork!
